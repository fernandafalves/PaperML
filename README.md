This repository presents the algorithms and instances used in the paper "Learning algorithms to deal with failures in production planning". In the "Approaches" folder, we have the algorithms for the proactive and proactive-online approaches. Inside these folders, the user will find the subfolders "Data_Tardiness" and "Data_Tardiness - Case II", which present the instances used for cases 1 and 2, respectively.

In the "Framework" and "Framework - Case II" folders, we present the algorithms used for the proposed framework for cases 1 and 2, respectively.
